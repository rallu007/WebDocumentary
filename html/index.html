            <div class="box_text_social">If someone asked you to offer some hopeless<br> young people a chance for a future, what<br> would you do? Well, Metin tried to make a<br> difference for some of them.
<br><br>
He offered a job position to some boys <br>from different countries (for eg. Syria) for<br> two months and taught them how to work <br>and act properly.  Now, they can have a <br>normal life where they can have a salary<br> and build a family.
                <br> <br>
                This mindset - be always better - gave<br>  Metin's  "Best in town Award", and proved <br> once for all that passion, ambition and <br> interest in others can make you one of <br> the best.
